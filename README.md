This website helps to find the names, websites and countries of the universities in the world.

The data was fetched from https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api.


It was originally hosted on netlify, but due to CORS policy, the api request was blocked (content was 'http' instead of 'https').

Hence, this website is currently served on http://localhost:5000/.
