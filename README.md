This website helps to find the names, websites and countries of the universities in the world.

The data was fetched from https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api.


It was originally hosted on netlify, but due to the fact CORS policy, the api request was blocked (content was 'http' instead of 'https'.

So therefore, this website is currently served on http://localhost:5000/.
